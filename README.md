# UK Car Equity Checker

A modern web app for UK car owners to instantly view the equity they currently have in their vehicle. Inspired by Apple’s design system, including a liquid glass effect.

## Features

- **Car Lookup:** Enter your car’s registration to retrieve details (make, model, year).
- **Add Finance Details:** Input your vehicle finance agreement (loan amount, payments, etc.).
- **Equity Calculation:** See your car’s current value minus the outstanding finance to view your equity.
- **Apple-Inspired Design:** Built using Apple’s design principles and a liquid glass visual effect for a modern, elegant user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (with TypeScript), styled-components, Apple-inspired UI library (e.g., [Apple Design System for React](https://github.com/Apple/design-system), or custom components)
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express (for future API integration)
- **APIs:** Vehicle lookup (e.g., DVLA), car valuation API (optional/future)
- **Styling:** Glassmorphism (liquid glass effect)

## How It Works

1. Enter car registration to fetch details.
2. Provide finance agreement details.
3. View equity instantly, with a beautiful Apple-style interface.
